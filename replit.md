# ExpiryGenie - Food Expiry Tracking Application

## Overview

ExpiryGenie is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help users track food expiry dates and reduce food waste. The app features a multi-page interface with user authentication, smart food tracking, calendar visualization, and statistics dashboard. Users can add food items through multiple methods including manual entry, voice input, and image/OCR scanning.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Layout**: Multi-page application with sidebar navigation
- **UI Components**: 
  - Landing page with hero section and feature showcase
  - Authentication system with login/signup forms
  - Dashboard for food item management
  - Calendar view with color-coded expiry dates
  - Statistics page with data visualization
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with color-coded theme (Green=Safe, Yellow=Soon, Red=Expired)

### Backend Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Database**: AWS S3 for cloud data storage with JSON format
- **Session Management**: Streamlit session state for user data persistence
- **File Storage**: S3 bucket with structured JSON files for users and food items

### Data Processing Components
- **OCR**: Tesseract for text extraction from images
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image preprocessing
- **Speech Recognition**: SpeechRecognition library for voice input
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI for natural language processing
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly for charts and calendar views

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- User registration and login functionality
- Password hashing using SHA-256
- Session-based authentication with Streamlit session state
- Database integration for user management

### Food Tracking System
- **Manual Entry**: Direct input with category selection and expiry date estimation
- **Voice Input**: Natural language processing to extract food items from speech
- **Image Processing**: OCR scanning of receipts and food labels
- **Smart Categorization**: Predefined food categories (Grocery, Dairy, Meat & Poultry, etc.)

### Data Storage Schema
- **S3 Structure**: 
  - `data/users.json` - All user accounts with email, name, password_hash, money_saved
  - `data/food_items/{user_hash}.json` - Individual user food inventories
- **CSV Export**: S3 data can be exported to CSV format with calculated fields

### Calendar Visualization
- Color-coded calendar view showing expiry dates
- Multiple view modes: Daily, Weekly, Monthly
- Interactive date selection with item details

### Statistics Dashboard
- Data analytics and visualization
- User savings tracking
- Food waste prevention metrics

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Login â†’ Session establishment â†’ S3 user verification
2. **Food Item Addition**: Input (Manual/Text/Image) â†’ AI Processing â†’ S3 JSON storage
3. **Calendar View**: S3 data retrieval â†’ Date processing â†’ Visual rendering
4. **Statistics**: Data aggregation from S3 â†’ Chart generation â†’ Dashboard display
5. **CSV Export**: S3 JSON data â†’ CSV format â†’ Download functionality
